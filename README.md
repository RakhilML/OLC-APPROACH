# OLC-APPROACH
The OLC method uses a combination of overlap detection, contig arrangement, and consensus sequence generation to reconstruct an accurate and thorough genome assembly.

Overlap, Layout and Consensus are the three main components of the OLC approach. The OLC method uses a combination of overlap detection, contig arrangement, and
consensus sequence generation to reconstruct an accurate and thorough genome assembly.

De novo genome assembly relies heavily on this iterative method, which is utilised by many different assembly algorithms and tools, including Raven.
# Overlap 
- Goal is to find regions where the reads align or overlap, indicating potential connections between them.
# Layout
- Goal is to create a layout that maximizes the coverage of the genome and minimizes gaps or misassembles.
# Consensus 
- Analyzing the overlapping regions between contigs and determining the most probable nucleotide at each position.

  The text files are the basic algorithm on how it works. In Addition to that a example can be seen for a consensus sequence.
