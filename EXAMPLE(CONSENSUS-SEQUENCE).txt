Example(consensus sequence)

Assume the consensus threshold 𝑇 = 0.5.

At position 0, we have ’A’ in all three reads. The count of ’A’ is 3, and the total number of aligned reads is 3.

Therefore, 33 = 1.0, which meets the threshold condition. Thus, the consensus nucleotide at position 0 is ’A’.

Moving to position 1, we have ’C’ in all three reads. Again, the count of ’C’ is 3, and the total number of aligned reads is 3. 
Thus, the consensus nucleotide at position 1 is ’C’.

At position 2, we have ’G’ in one read (𝑟1) and ’A’ in two reads (𝑟2 and 𝑟3). The count of ’G’ is 1, and the count of ’A’ is 2.
The total number of aligned reads is 3. 
Therefore, 23 = 0.67, which meets the threshold condition. 
Thus, the consensus nucleotide at position 2 is ’A’.

Finally, at position 3, we have ’T’ in two reads (𝑟2 and 𝑟3) and ’A’ in one read (𝑟1).
The count of ’T’ is 2, and the count of ’A’ is 1. The total number of aligned reads is 3. 
Therefore, 23 = 0.67, which meets the threshold condition. 
Thus, the consensus nucleotide at position 3 is ’T’.
Therefore, the consensus sequence would be ’ACAT’.

These are the core algorithms in raven that works iteratively, with the layout construction step refining and improving the assembly based on the detected overlaps.
The consensus generation step uses the final layout to generate a consensus sequence that represents the assembled genome.
